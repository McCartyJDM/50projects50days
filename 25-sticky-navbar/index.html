            <h2>Genesee River runs through</h2>
            <p>A city growing on the banks of the Genesee river, Rochester was settled after the American Revolution when the territory that would become the city was surrendered by the Iriquois tribes. Colonel Nathaniel Rochester bought land along the Genesee to utilize the river's waterfalls to generate power. After some time the town of Rochesterville which was formed became Rochester that we know of today. It was America's first boom town and doubled in population throughout the 1800s.</p>

            <h3>Home of Innovation</h3>
            <p>Rochester was at one point home to many household names and companies that opened their doors here at the start of the 20th century. The list includes Bausch + Lomb, Kodak, and Xerox were among the many to call Flower City their home. Although many have left the area, you can still visit the buildings which held their offices and have since converted to museums and event centers.</p>
